# Customer-Pulse-Unified-Platform

This work includes developing robust data processing and transformation processes to manage and organize data generation for machine learning models. The framework manages multiple tasks such as data cleansing, scrubbing, sanitization, preprocessing, transformation, and performance optimization. The goal is to manage uncertain data and organize it into a “good” format based on what scientists need.
